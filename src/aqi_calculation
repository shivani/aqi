How is AQI calculated?

1. The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its
24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health
breakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location.


2. All the eight pollutants may not be monitored at all the locations. Overall AQI is
calculated only if data are available for minimum three pollutants out of which one should
necessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Else, data are considered insufficient for calculating
AQI. Similarly, a minimum of 16 hoursâ€™ data is considered necessary for calculating subindex.


3. The sub-indices for monitored pollutants are calculated and disseminated, even if data are
inadequate for determining AQI. The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air
quality status for that pollutant.
